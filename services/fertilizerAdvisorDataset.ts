export const fertilizerAdvisorDataset: { [key: string]: string } = {
    "Maize_Sowing_Yes": "Recommendation: You have already applied the basal dose. No fertilizer needed now. Tip: Ensure good germination and wait for the knee-high stage for the next dose.",
    "Maize_Sowing_No": "Recommendation: Apply a basal dose of DAP (50 kg/acre) and MOP (20 kg/acre). Tip: Mix the fertilizer into the soil during the final land preparation before sowing.",
    "Maize_Vegetative_Yes": "Recommendation: This is the time for the second top dressing. Apply Urea (40-50 kg/acre). Tip: Apply fertilizer when the soil has adequate moisture for best uptake.",
    "Maize_Vegetative_No": "Recommendation: First top dressing is due. Apply Urea (40-50 kg/acre). Tip: Apply the fertilizer in a band near the plant rows, not directly on them.",
    "Maize_Flowering_Yes": "Recommendation: A final top dressing with MOP (15-20 kg/acre) can be beneficial. Tip: Potash is crucial for good grain filling and preventing lodging.",
    "Maize_Flowering_No": "Recommendation: It's late, but a dose of Urea (25 kg/acre) and MOP (15 kg/acre) is still beneficial. Tip: Do not over-apply nitrogen at this stage as it can delay maturity.",
    "Maize_Harvest_Yes": "Recommendation: No fertilizer is needed at this stage. Tip: Stop irrigation 10-15 days before harvesting to help the cobs dry.",
    "Maize_Harvest_No": "Recommendation: Do not apply any fertilizer now. It will not benefit the current crop. Tip: Plan to get your soil tested after harvest to know the nutrient status for the next crop.",
    "Sugarcane_Sowing_Yes": "Recommendation: Basal dose applied. Wait for the first irrigation cycle. Tip: Ensure setts are treated with fungicide before planting.",
    "Sugarcane_Sowing_No": "Recommendation: Apply a heavy basal dose: DAP (75 kg/acre), MOP (40 kg/acre), and Sulphur (10 kg/acre). Tip: Sugarcane is a heavy feeder; a strong foundation is key.",
    "Sugarcane_Vegetative_Yes": "Recommendation: Time for the second or third top dressing of Urea (60-70 kg/acre). Tip: Earthing up should be done after fertilizer application to support the cane.",
    "Sugarcane_Vegetative_No": "Recommendation: Start top dressing with Urea. Apply in 2-3 split doses of 60 kg/acre each. Tip: Apply fertilizer after irrigation for better results.",
    "Sugarcane_Flowering_Yes": "Recommendation: Potash application (MOP 30 kg/acre) is important now. Tip: Potash helps in sugar accumulation and improves cane quality.",
    "Sugarcane_Flowering_No": "Recommendation: It is crucial to apply Potash now (MOP 30 kg/acre) to improve yield. Tip: Avoid high nitrogen at this stage to prevent flowering (pogai).",
    "Sugarcane_Harvest_Yes": "Recommendation: No fertilizer needed. Tip: Harvesting should be done close to the ground level to save sugar-rich internodes.",
    "Sugarcane_Harvest_No": "Recommendation: Stop all fertilizer application. Tip: Plan for the ratoon crop management after harvesting.",
    "Soybean_Sowing_Yes": "Recommendation: Basal dose is done. No more fertilizer needed for now. Tip: Ensure you used a Rhizobium culture for better nitrogen fixation.",
    "Soybean_Sowing_No": "Recommendation: Apply a starter dose of DAP (25 kg/acre) and Sulphur (8 kg/acre). Tip: Soybean is a legume and fixes its own nitrogen, so it needs less N fertilizer.",
    "Soybean_Vegetative_Yes": "Recommendation: Generally, no nitrogen is needed. If leaves are very yellow, a light foliar spray of Urea (2%) can help. Tip: Monitor for insect pests during this stage.",
    "Soybean_Vegetative_No": "Recommendation: You missed the basal dose. Apply a mix of NPK fertilizer like 12:32:16 (50 kg/acre). Tip: A single application is usually sufficient for soybean.",
    "Soybean_Flowering_Yes": "Recommendation: A foliar spray of NPK 00:52:34 can boost pod formation. Tip: This is a critical stage for moisture; ensure soil is not dry.",
    "Soybean_Flowering_No": "Recommendation: Applying fertilizer now can help. Use a foliar spray of a water-soluble fertilizer. Tip: Avoid disturbing the plant too much during flowering.",
    "Soybean_Harvest_Yes": "Recommendation: No fertilizer is needed. Tip: Harvest when 95% of pods have turned brown and leaves have dropped.",
    "Soybean_Harvest_No": "Recommendation: Do not apply any fertilizer now. Tip: The crop is now mobilizing nutrients from leaves to the seeds.",
    "Groundnut_Sowing_Yes": "Recommendation: Basal dose done. Good to go. Tip: Ensure proper seed treatment to prevent collar rot.",
    "Groundnut_Sowing_No": "Recommendation: Apply DAP (25 kg/acre) and Gypsum (100 kg/acre) as a basal dose. Tip: Gypsum is essential for good pod development and provides calcium.",
    "Groundnut_Vegetative_Yes": "Recommendation: A second dose of Gypsum (100 kg/acre) should be applied at the start of flowering/pegging. Tip: Apply gypsum close to the plant base.",
    "Groundnut_Vegetative_No": "Recommendation: You missed the basal dose. Apply NPK mix and Gypsum immediately. Tip: Earthing up helps the pegs to penetrate the soil easily.",
    "Groundnut_Flowering_Yes": "Recommendation: If you haven't applied the second dose of Gypsum, do it now. Tip: This stage (pegging) is critical for yield; ensure adequate moisture.",
    "Groundnut_Flowering_No": "Recommendation: Apply Gypsum now. It is crucial for kernel development. Tip: A boron spray can also be helpful if your soil is deficient.",
    "Groundnut_Harvest_Yes": "Recommendation: No fertilizer is needed. Tip: Check for maturity by shelling a few pods. The inside of the shell should be dark.",
    "Groundnut_Harvest_No": "Recommendation: Stop all nutrient application. Tip: Proper drying after harvest is essential to prevent Aflatoxin."
